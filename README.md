# Zen-Flute
Zen Flute software--
You should be able to past this into an open program on the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
and download it to the Zen Composer Chip (a Teensy 4.0).  You will need to add the Teensyduino software to 
the Arduino IDE (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html).  The mainprogram goes in a first Arduino tab, followed 
by extra tabs for the .h and .cpp files.
